<div><h4>I love to travel and visit different places of interest.
    I love cars and I know them well.
    I want to visit the USA and some island in the ocean</h4></div>
<br>
<span>I have already visited Poland, England and Germany.
most of all I like traveling by car, in which you can visit those places that often do
    not bring tourists and see the real life of these countries</span>
